# Exact-Solution-Spinning-particle-Schwarzschild
Various notebooks and implementation of the analytical solution for the motion of spinning test particles in Schwarzschild space-time (and general formulas for static, spherically symmetric space-times). 

Please cite the paper "Analytical solutions for the motion of spinning particles near spherically symmetric black holes and exotic compact objects" by VojtÄ›ch Witzany and Gabriel A. Piovano if you use these nbs.

The files are:
- The Mathematica notebook "Exact-Schw-Spinning.nb" goes through the computations in the paper step by step apart from elliptic integration.
- The Maple notebook "Elliptic Ints SchwSpinParticle.mw" does the elliptic integrals.
- The pdf files are the plots from the paper (generated by .nb).
- The file "SchwarzschildSpinAnalytic.m" contains the long formulas for the frequencies and orbital evolution. (You can load these by using Get[] in Mathematica.)
