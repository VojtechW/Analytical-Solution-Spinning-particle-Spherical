# Exact-Solution-Spinning-particle-Schwarzschild
Various notebooks and implementation of exact solution for the motion of spinning test particles in Schwarzschild space-time

The Mma notebook "Exact-Schw-Spinning" goes through the computations in the paper step by step apart from elliptic integration.
The Maple notebook "Elliptic Ints SchwSpinParticle" does the elliptic integrals.
